An analog oscilloscope simulator.

This project is inspired by [Oscilloscope Music], where the music's audio
channels are designed to generate video when fed into the X/Y input of a scope.

The main goal of this project is to be able to render those videos, by
simulating the effects of the CRT vector display, with an audio track providing
the X/Y input.
